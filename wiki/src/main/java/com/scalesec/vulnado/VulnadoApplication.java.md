# VulnadoApplication Documentation

## Overview

The `VulnadoApplication` class serves as the entry point for a Spring Boot application. It is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` and `@ServletComponentScan`, enabling Spring Boot's auto-configuration and scanning for servlet components. The application also includes a call to a custom `Postgres.setup()` method, which likely initializes database-related configurations.

## Methods

### `main(String[] args)`
The `main` method is the entry point of the application. It performs the following tasks:
1. Calls `Postgres.setup()` to initialize database-related configurations.
2. Starts the Spring Boot application using `SpringApplication.run()`.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Type     | Description                          |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `args`    | `String[]` | Command-line arguments passed to the application. |

## Insights

- **Database Initialization**: The `Postgres.setup()` method is invoked before starting the Spring Boot application. This indicates that the application relies on a PostgreSQL database, and the setup method likely handles connection initialization or schema preparation.
- **Servlet Scanning**: The use of `@ServletComponentScan` suggests that the application may include custom servlets or filters that need to be registered automatically.
- **Spring Boot Framework**: The application leverages Spring Boot for rapid development and deployment, benefiting from its auto-configuration capabilities.
